****** Ben's examples *****

Simple initial inferences, not needing expression data: e.g. Variant v1 and variant V2 imply longevity; v1 pertains to gene G1 and V2 pertains to gene G2; G1 is in GO category GO7 and G2 is in Go category GO9 ;  GO7 intersects a lot with GO15 and GO9 intersects a lot with GO22; GO15 and Go22 are known to imply longevity.

(or more complex inference paths along these lines)

Among the crudities here are that we have to use links btw GO categories that are based on generic counting rather than expression in relevant contexts; and that we’re not looking at whether the variants v1 and v2 affect longevity via causing over or under expression in G1 and G2.

What can be done afterwards using expression data is…

We can insert knowledge about whether variant v1 tends to cause over or under expression in G1, etc.

We can then insert knowledge of the form “In lung tissue, in people age 50 or over, overexpression of G1 tends to cause overexpression of G15”

and also knowledge like “overexpression of G15 tends to cause longevity”

( we can also weight GO categories and inheritance/similarity links btw them based on expression data, leading to contextual probabilities which will be more useful)
