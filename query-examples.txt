1. How does gene FKH1 impact longevity in supercentenarians?

****** Ben's feedback ******

If the conceptual query is “How does FKH1 impact
longevity” then we are looking for

Implication (SNP in gene FKH1) Longevity

(where both of these are predicates that take argument Person) but we
are interested in the inference histories as much as the conclusion
truth valueIdeally we would like to find stuff like

Implication (SNP in gene FKH1) Pred_i

Implication Pred_i Longevity

for various Pred_i that are not too complicated.  Further
decomposition like

Implication (SNP in gene FKH1) Pred_i

Implication Pred_i Pred_j
Implication Pred_j Longevity

may also be interesting.  The Pred_i will involve GO categories, gene
names, pathway names etc. combined in various ways. If the conceptual
query is “How do FKH1 and FOX0 together impact longevity” then it’s
the same but starting from

Implication (SNP in gene FKH1 AND SNP in gene FOX0) Longevity

2. How do genes FKH1 and TOR interact in the context of longevity?

3. What are TOR's closest relationships to DNA repair?

4. What are TOR's closest relationships to DNA repair, in the
   longevity context?

5. How do apoptosis and DNA repair interact, in the longevity context?
